# BetterLoading NOT
____

### This package is **NOT for better loading**, it's for you developers who look for eastereggs for your code.

This package uses `spidersolitairegame` package and wraps it into nice, "secret" package that seems like nothing bad to your boss.

Simply include and
```typescript
// Secret phrase to display modal, number of suit types to display
new betterLoading();
```

By default you open it by konami code :) `↑↑↓↓←→←→BA` (without start)
To change code, use keyCodes (`[38,38,40,40,39,37,39,37,66,65]`)
To change number or suit types (1,2 or 4) set second parameter
