# BetterLoading NOT
____

### This package is **NOT for better loading**, it's for you developers who look for eastereggs for your code.

This package uses `spidersolitairegame` package and wraps it into nice, "secret" package that seems like nothing bad to your boss.

Simply include and
```typescript
// Secret phrase to display modal, number of suit types to display
new betterLoading('CODE', 1);
```
